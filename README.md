# Hand_Gesture_Number

*The Sign Language is a method of communication for deaf and dumb people. This project proposes a method that provides a basis development of Sign Language Recognition system for the Indian languages. There are sets of sign Images, each representing binary “up” and “down” positions of the five fingers. The method has been developed with respect to single user both in training and testing phase.  The static images have been pre-processed using feature point extraction method. The images are converted into text by identifying the fingertip position of static images using image processing techniques.

*As sign language is well structured code gesture, each gesture has a meaning assigned to it.  It can be used to express complex meanings by combining basic elements. In the last several years there has been an increased interest among the researchers in the field of sign language recognition to introduce means of interaction from human – human to human – computer interaction.
